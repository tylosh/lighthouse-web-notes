# W1D2 - Morning Session - The Dev Workflow


## MARKDOWN

- good for adding code to notes -> will render nice in GitHub


```js
var name = 'tyler'

```

## How to attack a problem

* always document the problem, parameters, inputs and outputs. Break it into pieces. *

make hypothesis
test hypothesis
make changes

-> repeat

good to create a variable and pass it through console.log to test

REPL - "Read Evaluate Print Loop" [place where you can write code and see it right away]
  -> node in Terminal (able to test right away in a constant environment)

after closing REPL ctrl + C twice, that data is gone

forEach - method - Amy review this.


* LSD - Logic, Syntax and Data [Three common errors to check] *

## Node Debugger

using debugger in the code -> break point, code will stop and can see where it's at? Need to review his notes.
  can repl in and see where stuff is at



# Afternoon Session

empty function (just nothing to pass to it)?


how computer interprets:
 - if in a block of code, use var -> creates a new local variable, otherwise, udpating a variable inside of a block will update the global variable

cmd d in sublime to edit multiple variables names the same thing. Need to continually hit cmd D to see them all be updated


*have to run console.log before a return to test what it might be*
always run console.log('------', test) -> helps make it obvious where the debug test is.
