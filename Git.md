2. Add files (if there) [terminal]                  git add _______.js or git add .  {all files}
3. Comitt changes [terminal]                        git commit -m "be descriptive - what's changed in the version"
4. Add link from GitHub to terminal/vagrant (use)   git remote add origin <URL>
5. Push updates to GitHub                           git push origin master
