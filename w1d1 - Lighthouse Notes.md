#W1D1 - Afternoon Breakout


use markdown for notes
  - good practice

  Many folders:

  Daily Folder Strucutre
   -w1d1
   -w1d2

## TERMINAL

- cd - change directory
- mkdir - makedirectory
- ls - list subdirectory
- touch - creates a file

cd .. (up one level?)

*maybe reach out to a mentor to get a better intro on Terminal*

## SUBLIME

- Command + 'O' (open folder in sublime)
  - make sure nothing is selected -> opens a folder

- Command  N, CMND Shift [] - cycles through
- ctrl + cmd + space (mac emoji)
- copy and paste

hold command - can indent many lines at same time?? what is this one?

* circle means not saved at the top of the tab

cmd + p - opens the quick find (for within the folder?)
cmd + f - find within file
cmd + shift + f - find within folder

ctrl cmd + up or down (move highlighted text around)

cmd / to comment in or out??? see his notes?


## VERSION CONTROL + DEMO

- VCS (verson control) - SVN, Git
  - dont use v1,v2 etc.

Philospohy of Git

- Repositories (REPOS)
A single folder for EVERY PROJECT (they should be separate!)

- commits - labelled, time stamps entry to your project

8 GIT commands that you need to know

-git init
-git status (very useful) - checks status of repo, any new files or changes?
-git add
-git committ [save that point in time]
-git remote [allow me to communivate with another computer]
    GitHub - is a remote tool
    **Always use SSH (allows you to not have to login again)**
-git pull
-git push
-git log

use the commit "detailed explanations"

git add . (adds all files in the folder)

lastpass?

*Git will show the different committs*

'git push origin master'
